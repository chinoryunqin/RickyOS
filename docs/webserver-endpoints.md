# Webserver Endpoints

This document describes the HTTP, WebSocket, WebDAV, and discovery endpoints
available while CrossPoint Reader is in File Transfer or Calibre Wireless mode.

- HTTP server: port 80
- WebSocket upload server: port 81
- UDP discovery listener: port 8134
- WebDAV: port 80, handled by the same HTTP server

Examples use `crosspoint.local`. If mDNS does not resolve on your network, use
the IP address shown on the device screen.

### RickyOS Read Pico memory reserve (0.4)

The derivative keeps all endpoints and capacities. Its two 4096-byte upload
buffers and 1400-byte listing buffer use PSRAM through HalMemory (9592 bytes
total), rather than competing for internal RAM. PSRAM allocation failure does
not fall back to scarce internal RAM. Other firmware retains normal allocation.

Startup requires at least 16 KiB internal free heap and a 4 KiB contiguous
block. After service construction and every 250 ms while handling requests,
the reserve is 8 KiB free and a 1 KiB contiguous block. A failed check stops
the service, closes uploads and disables Wi-Fi before showing the
translated memory message; Back, Home gesture or a tap returns to Home.
Saved Wi-Fi credentials are not erased. These are conservative admission
checks, not a guarantee against every allocation inside an SDK handler.
Transfers interrupted by a stop must be retried; ordinary HTTP files may be
left partial (unlike font staging / WebSocket cleanup). Font replacement protection
below still applies. Inspect NETMEM snapshots and MEM free/min/largest logs
on hardware; simulator heap statistics are synthetic.

## HTTP Pages

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/` | Home/status page |
| `GET` | `/files` | File manager page |
| `GET` | `/settings` | Web settings page |
| `GET` | `/fonts` | SD-card font manager page |
| `GET` | `/js/jszip.min.js` | JavaScript asset used by the file manager |

The routes are identical in every firmware. Both page locales are embedded;
Simplified-Chinese device UI selects `zh-CN`, and every other UI language uses
the English pages. Page locale follows the UI language directly.

## Device Status

### `GET /api/status`

```bash
curl http://crosspoint.local/api/status
```

Response:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "mode": "STA",
  "rssi": -45,
  "freeHeap": 123456,
  "uptime": 3600,
  "device": "X4"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | string | Firmware version |
| `ip` | string | Device IP address |
| `mode` | string | `"STA"` for joined Wi-Fi or `"AP"` for hotspot mode |
| `rssi` | number | Wi-Fi RSSI in dBm; `0` in AP mode |
| `freeHeap` | number | Free heap in bytes |
| `uptime` | number | Seconds since boot |
| `deviceId` | string | With `?plugin=<name>`: 64 hex chars, stable per device and plugin (SHA-256 of an on-device NVS secret and the name); omitted if NVS is unavailable |
| `device` | string | `"X3"` or `"X4"` hardware detection |

## File Management

### `GET /api/files`

Lists files and folders under a directory.

```bash
curl "http://crosspoint.local/api/files?path=/Books"
```

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | No | `/` | Directory to list |

Response:

```json
[
  {"name":"MyBook.epub","size":1234567,"isDirectory":false,"isEpub":true},
  {"name":"Notes","size":0,"isDirectory":true,"isEpub":false}
]
```

Hidden dotfiles are omitted unless the device setting `showHiddenFiles` is
enabled. `System Volume Information` and `XTCache` are always hidden/protected.

The response schema is unchanged for large directories. Entries are scanned
once and streamed as a chunked response in bounded batches, so the complete
listing is never retained in RAM. The server reserves its 1400-byte batch
buffer during startup; allocation failure now fails startup and releases the
services already created. The endpoint retains a defensive HTTP `503` response
if the buffer is unavailable.
The saved-credential stores (`/.crosspoint/wifi.json`, `opds.json`,
`koreader.json`) can never be downloaded, uploaded, renamed, moved, deleted or
written by a plugin over the network, however the path is spelled.

### `GET /download`

Downloads a file from the SD card.

```bash
curl -OJ "http://crosspoint.local/download?path=/Books/MyBook.epub"
```

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes | File path to download |

Protected dotfiles, `System Volume Information`, `XTCache`, and the credential
stores cannot be downloaded. EPUB files are served as `application/epub+zip`; other files use
`application/octet-stream`.

### `POST /upload`

Uploads a file with HTTP multipart form data.

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@mybook.epub" "http://crosspoint.local/upload?path=/Books"
```

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | No | `/` | Destination directory |

Successful response:

```text
File uploaded successfully: mybook.epub
```

Notes:

- Existing files with the same name are overwritten.
- EPUB cache data for the uploaded path is cleared after a successful upload.
- HTTP upload uses a 4 KB write buffer before flushing to the SD card.

### `POST /mkdir`

Creates a folder.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "name=NewFolder&path=/" http://crosspoint.local/mkdir
```

Form parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | - | New folder name |
| `path` | No | `/` | Parent folder |

### `POST /rename`

Renames a file.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "path=/Books/old.epub&name=new.epub" http://crosspoint.local/rename
```

Form parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes | Existing file path |
| `name` | Yes | New file name, not a path |

Only files can be renamed through this endpoint. The old EPUB cache path is
cleared before the rename.

### `POST /move`

Moves a file into an existing folder.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "path=/Books/mybook.epub&dest=/Read" http://crosspoint.local/move
```

Form parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes | Existing file path |
| `dest` | Yes | Existing destination folder |

Only files can be moved through this endpoint. The old EPUB cache path is
cleared before the move.

### `POST /delete`

Deletes one or more files or empty folders.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "path=/Books/mybook.epub" http://crosspoint.local/delete
curl -X POST -d 'paths=["/Books/old.epub","/OldFolder"]' http://crosspoint.local/delete
```

Form parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes, unless `paths` is provided | Single path to delete |
| `paths` | Yes, unless `path` is provided | JSON array of paths to delete |

Protected items cannot be deleted. Non-empty folders are rejected. EPUB cache
data for deleted files is cleared.

## Settings API

### `GET /api/settings`

Returns a streamed JSON array of editable settings. Each item contains common
fields plus type-specific fields.

```bash
curl http://crosspoint.local/api/settings
```

Example item:

```json
{
  "key": "fontSize",
  "name": "Reader Font Size",
  "category": "Reader",
  "type": "enum",
  "value": 1,
  "options": ["12 pt", "14 pt", "16 pt", "18 pt"]
}
```

For an enum, `value` is always an index into `options`, never the option's text.
For a toggle it is `0` or `1`; for a numeric value it is an integer and may be
negative. `fontSize` is one of the settings whose `options` are built at request
time — they are the point sizes the selected font family actually ships, so a
family installed at 10/12/14 offers three options. (`fontFamily` and
`dictionaryName` vary the same way, from the SD card contents.)
`value` is always an index into `options`, never the option's text. The
`fontSize` options depend on the selected family. A `.cpfont` family installed
at 10/12/14 pt offers those three sizes. TTF/OTF/TTC families offer the
standard 12/14/16/18 pt sizes. The `fontFamily` and `dictionaryName` options
also depend on the SD card contents.

Types:

| Type | Extra fields |
|------|--------------|
| `toggle` | `value` (`0` or `1`) |
| `enum` | `value`, `options` |
| `value` | `value`, `min`, `max`, `step` |
| `string` | `value` |

The font-family setting includes SD-card font families when they are installed.

Reader display settings include:

| Key | Type | Behavior |
|-----|------|----------|
| `readingGuideLineEnabled` | toggle | Enables line guides for EPUB and TXT |
| `readingGuideLineStyle` | enum | Solid, three dash lengths, dotted, or wavy |
| `readingGuideLineOffset` | value | Signed vertical offset from `-30` to `30` pixels |
| `readingBackgroundEnabled` | toggle | Uses the existing custom background cache for EPUB and TXT |
| `inxTabPosition` | enum | Places the Inx main tabs at the top (`0`) or bottom (`1`) |

The API can enable or disable an existing reading background, but selecting and
converting a PNG is a device workflow under **Settings > Reader > Reading
Background > Custom Image**. Disabling the setting does not delete that cache.

### `POST /api/settings`

Applies a partial settings update from a JSON object.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fontSize":2,"showHiddenFiles":1}' \
  http://crosspoint.local/api/settings
```

Successful response:

```text
Applied 2 setting(s)
```

## Font Management API

### `GET /api/fonts`

Lists installed SD-card font families. On devices that load TTF/OTF/TTC files,
these families appear with `sizes: [0]`. The `0` means that the font file has
no fixed point size; the reader offers 12, 14, 16, and 18 pt.

```bash
curl http://crosspoint.local/api/fonts
```

Response:

```json
{
  "maxFamilies": 128,
  "families": [
    {
      "name": "Literata",
      "sizes": [12, 14, 16, 18],
      "files": [
        {"name": "Literata_12.cpfont", "size": 123456}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/fonts/upload`

Uploads one `.cpfont` file into a family folder.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "family=Literata" \
  -F "file=@Literata_12.cpfont" \
  http://crosspoint.local/api/fonts/upload
```

The handler validates the family name, bounded `.cpfont` path, and `CPFONT`
magic bytes (including prefixes split across network chunks). Uploads use the
existing 4 KB buffer; every SD write and the final received-byte count must
match before success is returned. This is not full glyph/table validation.

Data is staged at `<filename>.upload-part`, not written over an installed font.
Replacing a font first renames the old file to `<filename>.upload-backup`, then
promotes the completed upload. A failed promotion attempts to restore the old
file. Invalid or aborted uploads remove only their own temporary file. Existing
unresolved temporary/backup files are not overwritten or deleted by a new
request: inspect them on the SD card and recover/remove them before retrying.
FAT renames are not a power-loss transaction. If rollback fails, the original
remains at the backup path; preserve it for recovery.

Malformed uploads return HTTP 400. SD open/write/rename failures return HTTP
500, not a false success. Only a completed installation marks the font registry
dirty. Reusing the same server instance releases upload buffers on `stop()`;
startup allocation failure also cleans up partially initialized resources.

Successful response:

```json
{"ok":true}
```

### `POST /api/fonts/delete`

Deletes an installed font family.

This endpoint removes family subfolders. To remove a loose TTF/OTF/TTC file
from a font root, delete the file from the SD card instead.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"family":"Literata"}' \
  http://crosspoint.local/api/fonts/delete
```

Successful response:

```json
{"ok":true}
```

## OPDS Server API

### `GET /api/opds`

Lists saved OPDS servers. Passwords are never returned.

```bash
curl http://crosspoint.local/api/opds
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "index": 0,
    "name": "My Catalog",
    "url": "http://calibre.local:8080/opds",
    "username": "reader",
    "hasPassword": true
  }
]
```

### `POST /api/opds`

Adds or updates an OPDS server. Include `index` to update an existing entry.
If `password` is omitted during an update, the existing password is preserved.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"My Catalog","url":"http://calibre.local:8080/opds","username":"reader","password":"secret"}' \
  http://crosspoint.local/api/opds
```

### `POST /api/opds/delete`

Deletes an OPDS server by index.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"index":0}' \
  http://crosspoint.local/api/opds/delete
```

## Wi-Fi Credential API

### `GET /api/wifi`

Lists saved Wi-Fi networks. Passwords are never returned.

```bash
curl http://crosspoint.local/api/wifi
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "index": 0,
    "ssid": "HomeWiFi",
    "hasPassword": true,
    "isLastConnected": true
  }
]
```

### `POST /api/wifi`

Adds or updates a saved Wi-Fi network. Include `index` to update an existing
entry. If `password` is omitted during an update, the existing password is
preserved.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ssid":"HomeWiFi","password":"secret"}' \
  http://crosspoint.local/api/wifi
```

### `POST /api/wifi/delete`

Deletes a saved Wi-Fi network by index.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"index":0}' \
  http://crosspoint.local/api/wifi/delete
```

## WebSocket Upload

### Port 81

The WebSocket path is used for fast binary uploads from the file manager and
Calibre plugin workflows.

Connection:

```text
ws://crosspoint.local:81/
```

Protocol:

1. Client sends text: `START:<filename>:<size>:<path>`
2. Server replies `READY`
3. Client sends binary chunks
4. Server sends `PROGRESS:<received>:<total>` every 64 KB or at completion
5. Server sends `DONE` when complete or `ERROR:<message>` on failure

Example session:

```text
Client -> START:mybook.epub:1234567:/Books
Server -> READY
Client -> [binary chunk]
Server -> PROGRESS:65536:1234567
...
Server -> DONE
```

Error messages include:

| Message | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| `ERROR:Upload already in progress` | A second upload was started before the first completed |
| `ERROR:Invalid START format` | Malformed START message or invalid size token |
| `ERROR:Failed to create file` | Destination file could not be opened |
| `ERROR:No upload in progress` | Binary data arrived without a matching START |
| `ERROR:Upload overflow` | Client sent more bytes than declared |
| `ERROR:Write failed - disk full?` | SD write failed |

Incomplete WebSocket uploads are deleted on disconnect or error.

## WebDAV

The same HTTP server registers a WebDAV-compatible handler for file manager clients.

Supported methods:

```text
OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, PROPFIND, MKCOL, MOVE, COPY, LOCK, UNLOCK
```

Notes:

- `PUT` writes to a temporary `.davtmp` file first, then renames it into place.
- Protected paths are rejected.
- `LOCK` and `UNLOCK` are accepted for client compatibility only. The server
  does not implement full WebDAV Class 2 locking semantics such as persistent
  locks or lock discovery.

## UDP Discovery

The server listens on UDP port `8134`. When it receives the text payload
`hello`, it replies to the sender with:

```text
crosspoint (on <hostname>);81
```

The final field is the WebSocket upload port.

## Network Modes

### Station Mode (STA)

- Device joins an existing 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network.
- `crosspoint.local` is advertised with mDNS when available.
- `/api/status` returns `"mode": "STA"` and RSSI in dBm.

### Access Point Mode (AP)

- Device creates an open hotspot named `CrossPoint-Reader`.
- The device shows a Wi-Fi QR code and URL QR code.
- The fallback IP is typically `192.168.4.1`.
- `/api/status` returns `"mode": "AP"` and `"rssi": 0`.

### Calibre Wireless

Calibre Wireless starts the same web server in STA mode and displays setup
instructions plus WebSocket upload progress on the device screen.

## Plugin API

Device capabilities for browser-side SD plugins (`plugin.js`). Plugins normally
reach these through the `PluginHost` wrappers (`api.relay`, `api.crypto`,
`api.fetchToSd`, `api.writeFile`); the raw contracts are below. Outbound TLS is
encrypted but the peer is not verified (the transport ships no CA bundle).

### `GET /api/plugins`

Installed plugins that ship a `plugin.js`:
`[{"name":"<folder>","dir":"<root>/<folder>","title":"<title>","mount":"settings"}, ...]`.
`dir` is where the plugin is installed (plugins keep their own files there);
`title` and `mount` come from the plugin's `manifest.json` when present.

### `GET /plugin?name=<plugin>&file=<file>`

Serves one file from the plugin's folder (first root holding that name). Both
parameters must be single path components (no `/`, `\`, or `..`); 404 when
the plugin, file, or a directory is requested.

### `POST /api/relay`

Makes an outbound HTTP(S) request for a plugin (any method; browsers can't, due
to CORS). Body: `{"plugin":"<name>","method":"GET","url":"https://...","headers":{...},"body":"..."}`.

- **Success:** `200` with the upstream body verbatim. The upstream status is
  in the `X-Relay-Status` response header, and its headers in `X-Relay-Headers`
  as JSON `[["name","value"], ...]` in receive order, duplicates kept (every
  `Set-Cookie`). `api.relay()` resolves to `{status, headers, body}`.
- **Redirects** are not followed: a 3xx comes back with its `location` header.
- **Limits:** the upstream body is capped at 32KB; larger payloads belong on
  `/api/fetch`.
- **Errors:** `400 {"error":"missing plugin/url"}`; `502 {"error":"relay failed; ..."}`
  for a transport failure, a truncated body, a body over the cap, or low memory
  (the device log names which).

### `POST /api/crypto`

Stateless wolfSSL primitives. Body `{"op":"<op>", ...}`; binary fields are
base64 in both directions, each at most 64KB encoded. Replies are `200` with
the result fields, or `200 {"error":"..."}`.

| `op` | Request fields | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `random` | `len` (default 16, max 4096) | `data` |
| `sha1` | `data` | `data` (20 bytes) |
| `sha256` | `data` | `data` (32 bytes) |
| `aesenc` | `key`, `iv` (16 bytes each), `data` | `data`: AES-128-CBC with PKCS#7 padding |
| `aesdec` | `key`, `iv`, `data` (block-aligned) | `data`: AES-128-CBC, padding left in place |
| `keygen` | none | `public` (SPKI DER), `private` (PKCS#8 DER): RSA key pair |
| `pubencrypt` | `cert` (X.509 DER), `data` | `data`: RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 to the certificate's key |
| `sign` | `private` (PKCS#8 DER), `hash` (20 bytes) | `data` (128 bytes): raw RSA signature |
| `rsadec` | `private` (PKCS#8 DER), `data` (one modulus block) | `data`: raw RSA private-key result, padding left in place |
| `pkcs12` | `data` (the bundle), `password` | `key`, `cert` (DER) |

### `POST /api/book-key`

Stores a protected book's content key for the reader. Body:
`{"path":"/abs/book.epub","key":"<base64, 16 bytes>","expires":<epoch seconds, optional>}`.
The device wraps the key with AES-256-GCM under a key derived from its NVS
secret and writes `<path>.key`; the header (including `expires`) is
authenticated, so the file only opens on this reader and its loan date cannot
be edited. The reader enforces `expires` when the book opens.

- **Success:** `200 {"ok":true}`.
- **Errors:** `400 {"error":"bad path/key"}`; `500 {"error":"cannot store key"}`.

### `POST /api/fetch`

Downloads a URL straight to SD, so a large body never passes through the
browser. Body: `{"plugin":"<name>","url":"...","dest":"/abs/path","headers":{...},"offset":0,"maxBytes":0}`.

- `dest` must be absolute with no `..`; missing parent folders are created.
- The transfer is staged in `<dest>.part` and replaces `dest` only when the
  whole body has arrived, so a failed update keeps the previous file.
- Up to 5 redirects are followed. `headers` (typically the plugin's
  `Authorization`) are sent only while the target keeps the starting URL's
  scheme, host, and port; a redirect elsewhere, including https→http, gets none.
- A body cut short mid-transfer resumes on its own with a Range request.
- **Segments:** `maxBytes` (at most 4MB) ends the request after that many
  bytes with `complete:false`; send the next request with `offset` set to the
  returned `bytes` to continue the same `.part`. `api.fetchToSd()` does this
  loop, keeping each browser request short.
- A long transfer answers early with `200` chunked and sends whitespace every
  5s to keep the browser connection open; the JSON result follows at the end.
- **Result:** `{"status":200,"bytes":N,"complete":true,"total":N}` (`total`
  when the server reported a size). `error` is set to `transport failure`,
  `http status`, or `sd write failed` when the file was not installed.
- **Errors:** `400 {"error":"bad url/dest"}`; `409 {"error":"offset mismatch","bytes":N}`
  when `offset` does not match the `.part` size; `502 {"error":"sd write failed" |
  "range unsupported" | "download truncated","bytes":N,"complete":false}`.

### `POST /api/plugin-fs?plugin=<name>&path=<abs path>`

Writes one small file to SD. The content is sent as a multipart file part
(`api.writeFile()` builds it), so binary data, including NUL bytes, arrives
intact. It streams to `<path>.tmp` and replaces `path` only after a complete,
non-empty body. `path` must be absolute, without `..`, and not a credential
store. A plugin keeps its own files in its install folder (`api.dir`).

- **Success:** `200 {"ok":true,"bytes":N}`.
- **Errors:** `400` (`bad path`, `empty body`, `missing file part`,
  `upload aborted`); `413 {"error":"too large"}` over 256KB; `500
  {"error":"cannot write" | "sd write failed"}`. The previous file is kept on
  every error.

## Plugin Job Queue

External systems trigger SD-plugin actions without the web UI. The firmware
stores opaque `{plugin, action, args}` blobs (fixed 6-slot pool; args/result
< 192 bytes JSON); an open page hosting the plugin executes them. See
`docs/sd-plugins.md` for the full contract.

### `POST /api/plugin-jobs`

```bash
curl -X POST http://crosspoint.local/api/plugin-jobs \
  -d '{"plugin":"<name>","action":"<action>","args":{"path":"/Books/somefile"}}'
# -> {"id":3}         (503 {"error":"job queue full"} when all slots busy)
```

### `GET /api/plugin-jobs/claim?plugin=<name>`

Executor-side (used by the plugin host page): returns the next pending job
`{"id":3,"claim":7,"action":"<action>","args":{...}}` and marks it running, or `{"id":0}`.
A running job whose lease expires returns to pending and gets a new `claim` when re-claimed.

### `POST /api/plugin-jobs/complete`

Executor-side: `{"id":3,"claim":7,"ok":true,"result":{...}}` -> `{"ok":true}`. The `claim`
must match the one from the claim response; a stale claim (the lease expired and another
executor re-claimed the job) gets `409 {"error":"stale claim"}` and changes nothing.

### `GET /api/plugin-jobs/status?id=<n>`

```bash
curl "http://crosspoint.local/api/plugin-jobs/status?id=3"
# -> {"id":3,"state":"done","result":{"title":"...","dest":"/Books/Book.epub"}}
```

States: `pending`, `running`, `done`, `error`, `unknown` (slot recycled —
poll promptly after completion).

### `GET /plugins-run`

Headless executor page: loads every plugin with its UI hidden so registered
actions run. Keep it open (browser tab or embedded webview) while jobs are
queued; jobs enqueued with no page open stay pending until one opens.

## Startup failure handling

`CrossPointWebServer::begin()` returns false when the application-level server,
upload, WebDAV, WebSocket or file-list allocations fail, or UDP discovery cannot
start. It releases partially started services and buffers before returning;
callers display the service screen only on success. `stop()` also releases the
UDP TX buffer retained by a failed socket creation, and a stopped object can be
started again. AP mode initialization failure returns before starting services.

Read Pico enables WiFi/LwIP PSRAM allocation while retaining the 32 KiB internal
reserve and 4096-byte ordinary-allocation threshold. The two 4096-byte upload
buffers and 1400-byte listing buffer prefer PSRAM, with internal fallback on
failure or devices without PSRAM in stock CrossMux. RickyOS on Read Pico instead
keeps the reserve guards described above and never falls back to internal RAM
after a PSRAM allocation failure. This does not make third-party constructors,
route registration, mDNS, or void-returning listener startup fully OOM-safe.

Run `python3 scripts/tests/test_webserver_startup_failure.py` for injected
allocation/socket failures, cleanup, repeated stop, retry, and AP startup guards.
Physical acceptance additionally requires AP and STA transfers; host stubs do
not exercise the actual WiFi driver or prove that every listener is reachable.
