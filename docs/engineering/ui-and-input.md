# UI, Orientation & Input

> Deep reference for [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). All rendering goes through the
> `GUI`/UITheme macro; all input goes through logical buttons. Hardcoded screen
> dimensions or raw hardware button indices are bugs.

## Orientation-Aware Logic
* No Hardcoding: Never assume 800 or 480. Use renderer.getScreenWidth() and renderer.getScreenHeight().
* Viewable Area: Use renderer.getOrientedViewableTRBL() to stay within physical bezel margins.
* Safe Content: Start from `UITheme::getScreenSafeArea()`, then reserve the active theme's header, spacing, and
  footer metrics before fitting custom boards or grids.
* Coordinate Bounds: `drawLine()` endpoints are inclusive, while rectangle width and height are extents. A
  full-width line therefore ends at `renderer.getScreenWidth() - 1`, never at the screen width itself.

## Logical Button Mapping

**Source**: [src/MappedInputManager.cpp:20-55](../../src/MappedInputManager.cpp)

Constraint: Physical button positions are fixed on hardware, but their logical functions change based on user settings and screen orientation.

**Button Categories**:
1. **Physical Fixed** (Up/Down side buttons):
   - `Button::Up` → Always `HalGPIO::BTN_UP`
   - `Button::Down` → Always `HalGPIO::BTN_DOWN`

2. **User Remappable** (Front buttons):
   - `Button::Back` → Maps to `SETTINGS.frontButtonBack` (hardware index)
   - `Button::Confirm` → Maps to `SETTINGS.frontButtonConfirm`
   - `Button::Left` → Maps to `SETTINGS.frontButtonLeft`
   - `Button::Right` → Maps to `SETTINGS.frontButtonRight`

3. **Reader-Specific** (Page navigation with optional swap):
   - `Button::PageBack` → Uses side button (swappable via `SETTINGS.sideButtonLayout`)
   - `Button::PageForward` → Uses side button (swappable)

**Implementation**:
- Activities use **logical buttons** (e.g., `Button::Confirm`)
- `MappedInputManager` translates to **physical hardware buttons**
- User can remap front buttons in settings
- Orientation changes handled separately by renderer coordinate transforms

**Rule**: Always use `MappedInputManager::Button::*` enums, never raw `HalGPIO::BTN_*` indices (except in ButtonRemapActivity).

## Input Frames and Event Semantics

The main loop updates `MappedInputManager` once per frame before dispatching
the active Activity. Normal Activities only read that shared snapshot; they
must not call `mappedInput.update()` themselves. A second update can erase an
edge before another input owner sees it.

| Query | Meaning | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `wasPressed(button)` | Press edge in the current frame | Immediate action whose duration does not matter |
| `wasReleased(button)` | Release edge in the current frame | Short action that waits for a complete gesture |
| `isPressed(button)` | Current held state | Long-press timing and transition guards |

Use one physical gesture for one semantic action:

- Use the press edge for a simple immediate action when that gesture cannot
  cross an input-owner boundary.
- Use the release edge for a short action when short and long presses coexist,
  or when the next owner should open only after the gesture is complete.
- After a long-press action fires, keep a handled flag until release and
  consume that release instead of also running the short action.

In the main Settings menu, short presses move one item while a held
`NavNext`/`NavPrevious` gesture moves by a full visible page at the shared
continuous-navigation interval. Settings subpages retain their own input
semantics.

## Activity and Popup Transitions

An Activity, popup, and resumed parent are separate input owners. If ownership
changes while the triggering key is held, the receiving owner needs a
**release barrier**:

- When opening a child while its trigger is still held, the child waits until
  that logical button is released before accepting input.
- When a child closes on a press edge, its result callback arms the parent's
  barrier only if `isPressed()` is still true.
- The frame that observes the release clears the barrier and still returns.
  This consumes the release edge instead of allowing it to trigger the parent.

Minimal parent-side pattern:

```cpp
void ParentActivity::onChildResult() {
    waitForConfirmRelease_ =
        mappedInput.isPressed(MappedInputManager::Button::Confirm);
}

void ParentActivity::loop() {
    if (waitForConfirmRelease_) {
        if (!mappedInput.isPressed(MappedInputManager::Button::Confirm)) {
            waitForConfirmRelease_ = false;
        }
        return;  // Consume the release frame too.
    }

    // Handle normal input from the shared snapshot.
}
```

Initialize a barrier from the held state, not from an edge query: the callback
may run after the edge's frame. Do not simulate consumption with another
`update()`, a delay, or raw GPIO access. Continue using logical buttons.
Touch input remains independent; only arm a physical-button barrier when that
button is actually held.

Home's Back-to-Standby shortcut is owned by `ActivityManager`, before the home
Activity's input loop. It applies to all `HomeActivity` themes, including Cover
Grid, and to INX Recent while focus is on the tabs. All use
`standbyShortcutEnabled`; selecting Standby directly in Apps remains independent.
The shortcut defaults to off on first boot, after restoring system settings, or
when the saved settings omit this key. Existing saved On/Off values are preserved;
users can enable it in Display settings.
The manager requires a local logical Back press followed by release, or a
completed touch Back gesture that publishes both edges in the same frame.
Push/Pop/Replace cancel the old pair; activation and parent restoration seed a
release barrier from the held state. Tab/focus actions and consumed long-press
releases also cancel the pair. An inherited hold never blocks independent touch
navigation, and its release cannot activate Standby. INX content Back returns to
the tabs, and other tabs return to Recent; entering Standby requires a new gesture.
This ownership guard does not change the SDK's button debounce interval.

Run `python3 scripts/tests/test_reading_ui_regressions.py` for the production
dispatch/transition regression cases. Enable the shortcut before testing its
activation. On ReadPico, hold the middle strip key to
exit the crash report, then release after Home appears: it must stay on Home.
A fresh middle-key press/release must enter Standby exactly once. Repeat on INX,
Classic, carousel, and Cover Grid, including returning from the control center
and disabling the shortcut. In INX content focus, the first Back returns to the
tabs; only a subsequent gesture enters Standby.

Settings enums normally cycle in place when they have two choices and open an
`OptionPopup` when they have more. A dynamic enum marked with
`withManagedEnumPicker()` always opens the popup and receives callbacks only
when the selected index changes. Its setter owns the complete change lifecycle,
including persistence, error feedback, and any required restart; the generic
settings flow must not save or rebuild after it returns.

## Touch Coordinate and Gesture Layers

Touch controllers keep their sampling, power, and panel-mount transforms in
the FreeInk SDK. `HalGPIO` exposes the normalized contact, and
`MappedInputManager` maps it through the renderer's live orientation before
classifying direction and edge geometry with FreeInkUI. Activities assign the
meaning: left-edge right swipe is Back, top-edge down swipe is Menu, and
bottom-edge up swipe is Home on every touch device. A hardware Home key remains
an additional input path and does not change those screen gestures.

## Long-Press Pattern

Start timing on `wasPressed()`. While `isPressed()` remains true, fire the
long action once after its threshold and mark the gesture handled. On
`wasReleased()`, run the short action only if the long action did not fire,
then reset the gesture state.

## Input Verification Matrix

Verify the invariant: **one physical gesture, one input owner, one semantic
action**.

| Scenario | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Press opens a child or popup | The child ignores the inherited hold and its release |
| Release opens a child or popup | The child stays open and waits for a new gesture |
| Child closes on press | The resumed parent consumes that gesture's release |
| Long press fires | The threshold action runs once; release does not run the short action |
| Logical buttons are remapped | Behavior is unchanged because no raw GPIO is used |
| Touch activates the same UI | It is not blocked unless the physical button is actually held |

## UITheme (The GUI Macro)
* Rule: All UI rendering must go through the GUI macro (UITheme).
* Do not hardcode fonts, colors, or positioning. This ensures orientation-aware layout consistency.
* Paginated custom grids should call `GUI.drawSideScrollBar()` with their item
  count, page start, and page capacity so the active theme controls the bar
  dimensions and placement.
* INX top-level tabs are owned by `ActivityManager`; only Activities with a
  non-`None` `MainTab` participate. Left/Right and tab touches are consumed
  before the page sees them, while reader and feature subpages remain outside
  the top-level loop. `SETTINGS.inxTabPosition` places this shared bar at the
  top or bottom; touch devices default to the bottom. In bottom mode, touch
  devices share a 28 px top status bar across all five main tabs, with the clock
  on the left and battery on the right. It uses the configured clock format,
  time zone and battery percentage visibility, and updates only when the page
  renders. Tapping the status bar opens the control center. Its drawing and hit
  region share the main-tab layout, which also reserves viewable margins and
  at least 6 px between the status bar, content and navigation. With top tabs,
  the touch INX Recent page displays only its bottom-right battery inside the
  existing 40 px footer reservation; it neither formats nor draws a footer clock
  and has no new touch action. Both placements use a 12 px logical-screen-edge
  inset, clamped to the board's oriented viewable margins rather than added to
  them. Clock and battery percentage share the numeric font and text baseline;
  positioning compensates for the battery icon's internal 6 px vertical offset. The clock
  uses a 9-byte stack buffer. Non-touch devices retain their existing home battery.
  `Activity::mainTabLayout()` resolves complete status, content and navigation
  rectangles in one pass; `pageContentRect()` also owns the normal-header
  fallback, so pages do not repeat the main-tab eligibility/layout calculation.
  Bottom navigation is 56 px high, with 38 px icons, 6 px bottom padding and
  a 38 × 5 px top selection marker. Only top navigation draws a full-width
  separator; device viewable margins and button-hint reservations remain additional.
* `GUI.drawProgressBar()` returns the first free Y coordinate after the bar and
  optional percentage line. Callers place following text from that value rather
  than reproducing the theme's font or spacing calculations.
* Functional subpages derive their body from `SubpageLayout::contentRect()` so
  headers, optional subheaders, button hints, and footers have one authoritative
  boundary. Related text keeps at least 4 px of separation, independent blocks
  keep at least 12 px, and custom drawing is clipped to that body.
* `ConfirmationActivity` uses one standard presentation: a 12 pt bold heading
  and a page body wrapped to at most two 10 pt lines. It computes those lines in
  `onEnter()`, never in `render()`, so button-driven redraws stay allocation-free.
* Center a progress state with `GUI.measureProgressBarHeight()`, then use the Y
  returned by `GUI.drawProgressBar()` for everything that follows. This keeps
  percentage text and subsequent details correct when a theme changes fonts.
* Cover views that must fill a fixed frame call
  `GfxRenderer::drawBitmapCropToFill()`. It scales and center-crops through two
  bounded row buffers and returns `false` on invalid input, read failure, or OOM
  so the caller can draw its fallback cover.
* INX front-button hints use black text above a 50% gray bottom line. Empty
  actions draw neither label nor line; directional actions use `<` and `>`.
* INX header subtitles share one rectangle for drawing and clipping, including
  their vertical centering offset. Clipping at the title's original top cuts off
  the smaller subtitle's lower glyph rows.
* On touch hardware, INX list and app-grid navigation focus follows the last
  input modality: touch hides it, while a physical button restores it. The
  logical selection and viewport remain intact, and FreeInkUI's active touch
  feedback plus semantic values such as checks and switches remain visible.

The calculator registers a dedicated built-in Noto Sans 18pt regular/bold family
for its expression and result, then unregisters it on exit. Legacy reader font
IDs (including `NOTOSANS_18_FONT_ID`) resolve to the 12pt offline fallback and
must not be used to select a larger display font. The two display rows reserve
their actual line heights plus at least 12 px spacing; overflowing text is
right-aligned and clipped to the display area. Error messages use the UI font
and its language fallback. Key labels retain their existing font.
The font tables stay in Flash. Drawing reuses the renderer's decompression
cache: the calculator's digits/operators require at most a 14,675-byte group
and 232-byte glyph scratch buffer, too large for the activity task stack.
Only one font-map entry is added on entry and removed on exit; no additional
framebuffer or SD font is needed.

The default sleep screen is Light. Existing saved sleep-screen selections are
preserved; the default applies when no selection has been saved.

RickyOS cold boot paints its complete logo once with FULL_REFRESH, without
an animation, forced dwell, or version footer. Normal wake and PostOTA retain
their distinct paths. Product Quick Resume overlays a small localized Standby
badge at the oriented safe area's bottom-right, reusing the retained framebuffer.
The reader orientation is applied for badge drawing then restored; night-mode
polarity and the existing FAST transfer/cache path remain. Sleep plugin delivery
receives no renderer on this path, so loading popups and handler toasts cannot
replace the retained reading page. Stock builds retain their moon indicator.

Product Settings → Power & Standby → Choose Standby Image opens an image-only
file picker followed by ImageViewer preview. BMP/PNG/JPG/JPEG are accepted.
The child returns to Settings on Back; cancellation does not install anything.
Settings row/catalog vectors are released before pushing the picker/decoder.
JPEG uses the existing fallible decoder and exclusive framebuffer scratch loan
to produce an on-SD Gray8 BMP; no extra full-screen buffer or resident decoder
is added. Successful preview is required before the Set Wallpaper action, which
reuses the existing checked-copy and settings-save rollback to `/sleep.bmp`.
The original file remains untouched. The independent idle Keep Page option can
still override a wallpaper on automatic sleep; turn it off to use wallpaper then.
Power-loss/FAT recovery, decoder memory limits, night-mode polarity and e-paper
quality require device acceptance rather than simulator claims.

### WiFi connection status

Touch and button devices share the upstream connection layout: the connection
status is centered above the SSID, which retains the translated "to" prefix.
On touch devices the text uses the body below the header/MAC band and above
the Cancel/Show Networks buttons, rather than placing the SSID in a top-aligned
text area. Scanning displays only the centered status. Physical button hints
remain exclusive to button devices. The SSID label uses a bounded stack buffer;
long names keep the existing ellipsis style at a complete UTF-8 boundary and
are clipped to the content width.

## Retained Framebuffer Updates

The firmware has one framebuffer, and its contents remain available after
`displayBuffer()`. A hot UI path may redraw only the changed items, but only
when it can identify the exact frame already in that buffer:

- Snapshot cross-task UI state once at the start of `render()`; never read a
  mutable selection again inside an item loop.
- Track the framebuffer's selection/page in render-task-owned state. Invalidate
  that state before shelf/list content changes, an asset finishes loading, or
  the layout changes.
- Clear and redraw the full screen when the retained frame is invalid or the
  target is on another page. Otherwise restore the old item and draw the new
  item; do not allocate a second buffer.
- After drawing, record what the framebuffer now contains, then re-read the
  cross-task state. If it changed, request an immediate render and return before
  `displayBuffer()` so the stale frame never reaches the panel. Keep the recorded
  framebuffer state even for that skipped panel update, because the next render
  builds from it.

Incremental drawing does not imply a different panel waveform or windowed
refresh. Those are display-driver decisions and require separate hardware
measurement.

### File browser images

The file browser lists BMP, JPEG (`.jpg` / `.jpeg`), and PNG files, with
case-insensitive extensions, in every directory including `/AirPage`. All three
formats open in the image viewer and participate in its sorted sibling navigation.
Firmware and PNG-only pickers retain their own filters.

BMPs render directly. JPEG and PNG previews reuse
`/.crosspoint/image_preview.bmp`; JPEG conversion fits the current oriented screen
without cropping. Conversion borrows the existing framebuffer and streams through
the existing converters instead of adding another full-screen buffer. A failed
conversion cannot display an old preview or save it as a sleep cover. JPEG sleep
covers use the converted BMP; PNG retains its normal and transparent cover choices.
The temporary preview is removed on exit, and source images are never replaced.

### Lyra Carousel home

Lyra Carousel displays one centered recent-book cover in a `380x540` frame.
The complete image is scaled proportionally to fit and centered with white
letterboxing when its aspect ratio differs; it is never cropped or stretched.
The frame is drawn only while the cover row has focus. Its Apps menu icon uses
a theme-local `28x28` four-cell drawing inside the standard `32x32` icon slot;
shared icon assets and other themes remain unchanged.

INX SDK layout compatibility and regression coverage: [INX theme compatibility](inx-theme-compatibility.md).

RickyOS product main pages use category cards for Storage and the Settings
root, with shared drawing/hit geometry in `RickyPageLayout` / `RickyPageUi`.
Each uses the existing `ListNav` virtual viewport (six items) for button
selection; no second gesture owner or framebuffer is introduced. Settings
child pages remain lists with enter/back navigation. Product Library uses a
four-book page, retains All/Reading/Unread, and moves sort/rebuild into More.
The configurable Home phrase uses a two-line reservation and defaults when its
bounded settings field is empty. Product cover placeholders draw real titles
when there is no usable cover bitmap; stock placeholder art is unchanged.

The RickyOS product's advertised visual chrome differs from stock INX: it uses
native thin-line icons plus localized names in a 116 px high-DPI (86 px normal)
bar with a gray rule, and a heavier active name instead of the stock top marker.
The active icon expands existing ink by a bounded 2 px high-DPI (1 px normal)
radius inside its original slot; inactive pixels stay unchanged. This adds no
bitmap asset, heap cache, resampling buffer or change to touch bounds.
The same reserved rectangle owns drawing and tab input in both placements.
Library uses text/underline filters and a live heading count; Storage uses open,
left-aligned sections with gray rules. Storage orientation comes from the full
content rectangle, not the reduced category body, so portrait remains 2×2.
Portrait Home has a nickname greeting, real continue/progress, two tall recent
covers with two-line titles, split today/streak below the books, and the custom
phrase. Its geometry budgets both title lines and progress labels before
allocating the remaining height to covers, rather than leaving a wide-tile void.
Continue Reading receives 60% of the available cover-height budget (capped at
half the content width); recent covers share the remaining 40%, establishing
the current book as the primary visual. Title/progress/gap reservations remain.
Five localized greetings use the current profile nickname; one is selected on
Activity entry with UTC/visit-count mixing and no immediate repeat. Redraws and
cover generation retain it; returning from profile editing updates the nickname
without choosing a new greeting. There is no refresh timer or network request.
The existing bounded greeting buffer is reused; no greeting heap is added.
Home multiline labels and title-only cover fallbacks use SDK `layoutText`'s
fixed-capacity UTF-8 character splitting and emit single-line runs to the native
target. This avoids the native renderer's no-space-word truncation and its
temporary wrap vectors, and agrees with the SDK measurement used for height.
Product covers use centered, aspect-preserving downscaling instead of crop-fill.
Both rows share one thumbnail cache height, so drawing differently-sized cards
does not repeatedly invalidate the existing bounded cover caches. Stock cover
rendering and all retained recent-book pagination remain unchanged.
No layout-only rewrite creates
reading statistics or chapter metadata; missing values are not made up.
Product main pages omit decorative help copy: Home has no phrase caption,
Library has no books/folders footer, and Storage has no intro or category
descriptions. Their layout reservations are removed too; the editable phrase,
category names, page counters and missing-folder feedback remain functional.

RickyOS fixes the product UI to its customized INX renderer. Its shared settings
catalog omits theme, Home/Library/Apps layout and tab-position rows. Product
loading and theme selection/reload enforce INX, Flow Home, icon Library/Apps,
and bottom navigation. JSON loading normalizes historical values and requests
a resave; JSON saving emits fixed compatible IDs, and legacy binary migration
ignores the old theme field and normalizes layouts. Other preferences and
enum IDs remain unchanged. `UITheme` owns one lifetime `InxTheme` member on the
product path; selection/reload cannot allocate or fall back to another layout.
Product builds omit standalone RoundedRaff, Lyra 3 Covers and Lyra Carousel
translation units, while retaining Lyra/Base implementation inherited by INX.
Stock builds keep the original theme picker, PSRAM capability and OOM fallback.

### Missing glyphs

After the existing font selection/fallback and SD on-demand lookup, unsupported
visible characters render as hollow squares. `missingGlyph::metrics` is shared
by text bounds, advances, SD advance prewarm and rendering: the side is three
quarters of the font ascender (clamped to 4–255 px), with one pixel of spacing
on each side and the bottom aligned to the baseline. The outline is procedural;
it allocates no bitmap or heap storage. SUP/SUB halves the metrics, and rotated
text uses the same orientation mapping as real glyphs. Missing glyphs do not
participate in kerning. Missing whitespace, controls, zero-width formatters and
combining marks produce no square. Real U+FFFD text is still rendered when the
font contains it; missing characters no longer borrow its glyph or width.
